On top of that, it allows for easier and faster printing then softer TPU grades. Parts printed with Ultrafuse® TPU 95A show a high elongation, good impact resistance, excellent layer adhesion and a good resistance to oils and common industrially used chemicals. Due to its good printing behavior, Ultrafuse® TPU 95A is a good choice for starting printing flexible materials on both direct drive and bowden style printers.\n\nPrinting Recommendations:\nUltrafuse TPU can be printed directly onto a clean build plate. A small amount of 3Dlac can make removal easier after printing."
